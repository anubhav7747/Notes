## What is M2M gateway? What is the purpose or necessity of an M2M gateway?
An M2M (Machine-to-Machine) gateway is a device that provides a communication link between locally networked devices and a wired or wireless broadband connection. It hosts various applications and networking stacks, running on virtual machines on one or more CPU cores. In other words, it acts as a bridge between the local network (which can be wired or wireless) and the internet.

The purpose or necessity of an M2M gateway is manifold:

1. **Protocol Translation**: M2M gateways perform protocol translations to enable IP-connectivity for M2M area networks. They act as a proxy performing translations from/to native protocols to/from Internet Protocol (IP).

2. **Connectivity**: M2M gateways are key for connecting clusters of low-energy, low-cost M2M devices that are deployed around buildings, campuses, and city streets. They enable these devices to communicate with each other and with the internet.

3. **Security**: Since M2M equipment will be on the Internet and will often be deployed in publicly accessible areas, security is required to help with both physical tampering and malicious network attacks.

4. **Efficiency**: M2M gateways help make M2M communication more efficient by managing the communication between a large number of devices and the internet.

In summary, M2M gateways play a crucial role in M2M communication by providing connectivity, enabling protocol translation, ensuring security, and managing communication efficiency.

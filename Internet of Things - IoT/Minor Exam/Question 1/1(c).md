## What do you mean by machine to machine (M2M) communications? Discuss its type. How it is differ from IoT?
**Machine-to-Machine (M2M) communication** is a form of data communication that involves one or more entities that do not necessarily require human interaction or intervention in the process of communication. M2M is also named as Machine Type Communication (MTC) in 3GPP. It involves the seamless connection and interaction of devices, enabling them to exchange information and perform actions based on the received data.

**Types of M2M Communications**:
1. **Wired M2M Communication**: The data transfer between the devices occurs over a wired transfer medium.
2. **Wireless M2M Communication**: This includes technologies such as WiFi, Bluetooth, Zigbee, and more recently wireless cellular networks such as 3G and beyond.

**Difference between M2M and IoT**:
- **Internet of Things (IoT)** is a network of physical objects embedded with software, sensors, and other technologies to connect and share data with multiple devices over the internet. IoT is an ecosystem where the devices share data through a communication media known as the internet.
- **M2M**, on the other hand, is a direct communication system between the devices using wired or wireless communications channels without any human interaction. It collects the data and shares it with other connected devices.
- M2M is a subset of IoT. The point-to-point communication of M2M is the main difference between M2M and IoT technology. Meanwhile, an IoT system usually locates its devices within a global cloud network that facilitates larger-scale automation and more advanced applications.
- Another key difference between IoT and M2M is scalability. IoT is designed to be highly scalable because devices may also be included in the network and integrated into existing networks with minimal issues. In contrast, maintaining and setting up M2M networks could also be more labor-intensive, as new point-to-point connections must be built for each system.

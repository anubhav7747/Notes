## Examples
Here are some examples of Internet of Things (IoT) devices:

1. **Sensors**: These are one of the oldest and most common types of IoT devices. They are used both by individuals and businesses. Some of the most common examples include optical sensors for automatic street lights, temperature sensors for thermostats, and the internal sensors embedded in industrial machinery.

2. **Security Devices**: IoT motion sensors are often included as part of more advanced security systems, smart home security cameras, and audio recording devices in residential, commercial, and industrial spaces.

3. **Smart Home Devices**: These include devices like speakers as well as intelligent light bulbs, connected smoke detectors, and smart door locks. Intelligent appliances include smart home devices like smart thermostats, intelligent refrigerators, and connected televisions.

4. **Smart Wearables**: Smart wearable technology is one of the most recognizable IoT devices. Right now, the most common wearables are fitness trackers, watches, and earbuds. However, smart glasses and virtual reality headsets are gaining popularity.

5. **Personal Medical Devices**: Personal medical devices like pacemakers are also IoT devices. Remote medical devices can help monitor and share a patient's vital signs or detect early signs of health issues for fast intervention.

6. **Autonomous Vehicles**: Self-driving cars and other connected vehicles rely on the internet to share real-time information. Sensors throughout the vehicle help map its surroundings, transmit camera footage, and respond to traffic signals.

These are just a few examples. The potential applications of IoT are vast and varied, and its impact is already being felt across a wide range of industries, including manufacturing, transportation, healthcare, and agriculture.

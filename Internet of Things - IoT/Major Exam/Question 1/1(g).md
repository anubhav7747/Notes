# Discuss the structure of Arduino program and write Arduino program for switching LED on and off regularly. Differentiate between Arduino and Raspberry pi.
Let's start by discussing the structure of an Arduino program, followed by writing a simple program to switch an LED on and off regularly. Then, I'll highlight the key differences between Arduino and Raspberry Pi.

## Structure of an Arduino Program:
An Arduino program, also known as a **sketch**, follows a basic structure with two essential functions:

1. **`setup()` Function**:
   - This function runs once when the Arduino starts.
   - It initializes variables, sets pin modes, and performs any necessary setup.

2. **`loop()` Function**:
   - This function runs repeatedly after `setup()` completes.
   - It contains the main logic of your program.

Here's a basic example of an Arduino sketch:

```cpp
void setup() {
    pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT); // Set LED_PIN as an output
}

void loop() {
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH); // Turn LED on
    delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW); // Turn LED off
    delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second
}
```

## Example: Blinking an LED:
Let's create a program that blinks an LED connected to pin 13 (you can adjust the pin number based on your setup):

```cpp
const int LED_PIN = 13; // Define the LED pin

void setup() {
    pinMode(LED_PIN, OUTPUT); // Set LED_PIN as an output
}

void loop() {
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, HIGH); // Turn LED on
    delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second
    digitalWrite(LED_PIN, LOW); // Turn LED off
    delay(1000); // Wait for 1 second
}
```

## Differences Between Arduino and Raspberry Pi:
1. **Purpose**:
   - **Arduino**: Designed for simpler, real-time control tasks with low power consumption.
   - **Raspberry Pi**: Acts as a mini-computer with more processing power, capable of running an operating system.

2. **Hardware**:
   - **Arduino**: Microcontroller-based board (e.g., ATmega328P) with CPU, RAM, and ROM integrated.
   - **Raspberry Pi**: Microprocessor-based single-board computer (SBC) with CPU, RAM, and external storage (SD card) for an OS.

3. **Programming**:
   - **Arduino**: Uses a simplified C/C++ language for sketches.
   - **Raspberry Pi**: Supports various programming languages (Python, C++, etc.) and can run complex applications.

4. **Connectivity**:
   - **Arduino**: Limited connectivity (GPIO pins, serial communication).
   - **Raspberry Pi**: Extensive connectivity (USB, HDMI, Ethernet, Wi-Fi, Bluetooth, etc.).

5. **Operating System**:
   - **Arduino**: No OS; runs directly on hardware.
   - **Raspberry Pi**: Runs a full Linux-based OS (e.g., Raspbian) with multitasking capabilities.

In summary, choose Arduino for simple control tasks and Raspberry Pi for more complex projects! ðŸ˜ŠðŸ”ŒðŸ¤–

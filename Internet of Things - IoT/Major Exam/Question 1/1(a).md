# Briefly describe IoT enabling technologies.
Internet of Things (IoT) enabling technologies play a crucial role in making IoT applications possible. Here are some key technologies:

1. **Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN)**: WSNs consist of distributed devices with sensors that monitor environmental and physical conditions. These networks include end nodes, routers, and coordinators. Examples of WSN applications include weather monitoring, indoor air quality monitoring, soil moisture monitoring, surveillance systems, and health monitoring.

2. **Cloud Computing**: Cloud computing allows users to access applications as utilities over the internet. It provides services like Infrastructure as a Service (IaaS), Platform as a Service (PaaS), and Software as a Service (SaaS). Major cloud providers include Google Compute Engine, Amazon Web Services, and Microsoft Azure.

3. **Big Data Analytics**: Big data analytics involves studying massive volumes of data. It's collected from various sources such as social networks, videos, sensors, and sales records. Analyzing big data helps extract valuable insights and patterns.

4. **Communication Protocols**: Standard protocols and networking technologies are essential for IoT. These include RFID, NFC, low-energy Bluetooth, low-energy wireless, low-energy radio protocols, and LTE-A.

5. **Embedded Systems**: These are specialized computing systems integrated into devices. They enable communication, data processing, and control in IoT devices.

Remember, IoT technologies are diverse and continually evolving, driving innovation across various domains! üòäüåêüì°

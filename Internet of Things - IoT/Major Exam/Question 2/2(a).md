# Explain with help of diagram to develop sensor based IoT healthcare system using raspberry pi.
Developing a sensor-based IoT healthcare system using Raspberry Pi involves integrating sensors, data processing, and communication. Let's break it down:

1. **Sensors**:
   - Choose appropriate sensors for health monitoring. Common ones include:
     - **ECG Sensor**: Measures heart electrical activity.
     - **Temperature Sensor**: Monitors body temperature.
     - **SpO2 Sensor**: Measures blood oxygen saturation.
     - **Heart Rate Sensor**: Tracks pulse rate.
   - Connect these sensors to the Raspberry Pi GPIO pins.

2. **Raspberry Pi**:
   - The central processing unit that collects data from sensors.
   - Runs an operating system (e.g., Raspbian).
   - Communicates with sensors via GPIO pins.

3. **Data Processing**:
   - Raspberry Pi processes sensor data:
     - Reads ECG waveforms.
     - Calculates heart rate, SpO2, and temperature.
   - Converts analog sensor readings to digital data.

4. **Communication**:
   - Transmit data to an IoT server or cloud platform:
     - Via Wi-Fi, Ethernet, or cellular networks.
     - Use MQTT, HTTP, or other protocols.
   - Securely send data to a central server for storage and analysis.

5. **IoT Server/Cloud**:
   - Receives data from Raspberry Pi.
   - Stores patient health records.
   - Provides real-time monitoring and alerts.

Here's a simplified diagram:

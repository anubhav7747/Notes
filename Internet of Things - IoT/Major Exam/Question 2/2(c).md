# What is SDN? Explain the layers that make up SDN.
**Software-Defined Networking (SDN)** is an innovative approach to network management. It enables dynamic and programmatically efficient network configuration, improving network performance and monitoring. Unlike traditional network management, SDN operates more like cloud computing, allowing centralized control and flexibility. In SDN, a software-controlled architecture communicates with IT infrastructure and directs network traffic.

Let's explore the layers that constitute SDN:

1. **Application Layer**:
   - Houses network applications and services.
   - Communicates with the control layer via northbound APIs.
   - Manages data plane functions, replacing traditional dedicated appliances (e.g., firewalls, load balancers).

2. **Control Layer**:
   - Acts as the "brain" of the network.
   - Orchestrates traffic movement and resource allocation.
   - Facilitates communication between the application layer and the infrastructure layer.

3. **Infrastructure Layer**:
   - Comprises physical switches, routers, and supporting hardware.
   - Handles data packet movement and network traffic.

In summary, SDN empowers dynamic, programmable network configuration akin to cloud computing, revolutionizing how we manage and optimize networks! üòäüåêüîå

## Characteristics 
The Internet of Things (IoT) has several key characteristics:

1. **Connectivity**: IoT devices are connected to the internet, allowing them to send and receive data.
2. **Identity**: Each IoT device has a unique identifier, which helps differentiate it from other devices.
3. **Intelligence**: IoT devices use sensors and software to collect and analyze data.
4. **Scalability**: IoT systems can handle large amounts of data and generate useful analysis.
5. **Dynamic Nature**: IoT devices are designed to adapt to their environment.
6. **Self-Upgradation**: IoT devices can upgrade themselves without human intervention.
7. **Architecture**: IoT systems typically include several components, including IoT devices, communication networks, gateways, and cloud-based data processing and storage systems.
8. **Security**: Given the sensitive nature of the data they handle, IoT devices must have robust security measures in place.
9. **Interoperability**: IoT devices can interact with each other and with other internet-enabled devices.
10. **Embedded Sensors and Actuators**: IoT devices often contain sensors and actuators that allow them to interact with the physical world.

These characteristics enable IoT devices to transform various industries, from healthcare and manufacturing to transportation and energy, by generating vast amounts of data, which can be analyzed to improve operations, drive innovation, and create new business opportunities.

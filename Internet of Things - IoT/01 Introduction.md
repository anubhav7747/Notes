## Introduction
The Internet of Things (IoT) refers to a network of physical devices, vehicles, appliances, and other objects that are embedded with sensors, software, and network connectivity. This allows them to collect and share data. These devices, also known as “smart objects”, can range from simple “smart home” devices like smart thermostats, to wearables like smartwatches, to complex industrial machinery and transportation systems.

IoT enables these smart devices to communicate with each other and with other internet-enabled devices, like smartphones and gateways, creating a vast network of interconnected devices that can exchange data and perform a variety of tasks autonomously. This can include everything from monitoring environmental conditions in farms, to managing traffic patterns with smart cars, to controlling machines and processes in factories, to tracking inventory and shipments in warehouses.

The potential applications of IoT are vast and varied, and its impact is already being felt across a wide range of industries, including manufacturing, transportation, healthcare, and agriculture. As the number of internet-connected devices continues to grow, IoT is likely to play an increasingly important role in shaping our world and transforming the way we live, work, and interact with each other.

### Definition:
The Internet of Things (IoT) is a system of interrelated computing devices, mechanical and digital machines, objects, animals or people that are provided with unique identifiers (UIDs) and the ability to transfer data over a network without requiring human-to-human or human-to-computer interaction. It has evolved from the convergence of wireless technologies, micro-electromechanical systems (MEMS), microservices and the internet. The convergence has helped tear down the silo walls between operational technology (OT) and information technology (IT), allowing unstructured machine-generated data to be analyzed for insights to drive improvements. IoT is also a key component of Industry 4.0, the digital transformation of industrial markets (also known as the fourth industrial revolution).

## Difference between IoT and M2M

| Features | IoT | M2M |
| -------- | -------- | -------- |
| **Abbreviaion** | Internet-of-things | Machine-to-Machine communication |
| **Communication** | IoT sensors automation | Communicates directly between machines |
| **Connection** | The connection is via using various communication types. | Point-to-Point Connection |
| **Communication protocols** | HTTP, Ftp, Telnet, etc are used. | Communication technology techniques and traditional protocols are used. |
| **Data Sharing** | Data is shared with applications that tend to improve the end-user experience. | Data is shared with the communication parties themselves. |
| **Scope** | Many users can connect at a time over the Internet. | Communicate with a single machine at a time. |
| **Business Type** | B2C(Business to Customers) and B2B(Business to Business). | Only B2B(Business to Business) is used. |
| **Data Delivery** | Depending on the Internet protocol. | Devices can be connected through mobile or other networks. |
| **Technology** | Hardware and Software based technology. | Hardware-based technology |
| **Intelligence** | Objects are responsible for decision-making. | Observation of some degree of intelligence. |
| **Example** | Big Data, Cloud, Smart wearables, and many more. | Data and Information, sensors, and many more. |

### Key Difference
The Internet of Things (IoT) is the network of physical devices, vehicles, home appliances, and others embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and connectivity which enables these things to connect and exchange data, creating opportunities for more immediate integration between the physical world and computer-based systems.

With regard to M2M (machine-to-machine) communication, there are several differences. The M2M communications are used to connect machines to machines within the same cellular network. The IoT is used to connect machines to machines across different cellular networks.

# How does IoT work? (Components of IoT)
The Internet of Things (IoT) works by connecting physical devices to the internet, allowing them to communicate and share data. Here's a simple breakdown of how an IoT system works:

1. **Sensors/Devices**: First, sensors or devices collect data from their environment. This could be as simple as a temperature reading or as complex as a full video feed.

2. **Connectivity**: Next, that data is sent to the cloud, but it needs a way to get there! The sensors/devices can be connected to the cloud through a variety of methods including cellular, satellite, WiFi, Bluetooth, low-power wide-area networks (LPWAN), or connecting directly to the internet via ethernet.

3. **Data Processing**: Once the data gets to the cloud, software performs some kind of processing on it. This could be very simple, such as checking that the temperature reading is within an acceptable range. Or it could also be very complex, such as using computer vision on video to identify objects.

4. **User Interface**: Finally, the information is made useful to the end-user in some way. This could involve sending an alert to the user, triggering an automatic response, or simply storing the data for future use.

So, in essence, IoT works by collecting data from the environment, sending it to the cloud, processing that data, and then using it in a way that is useful to the end-user.

## Applications of IoT
The Internet of Things (IoT) has a wide range of applications across various domains. Here are some of them:

1. **Wearables**: Wearable technology is one of the earliest industries to deploy IoT. Devices like fitness trackers, smartwatches, and health monitoring devices like the Guardian glucose monitoring device for people with diabetes are common examples.

2. **Smart Home Applications**: The smart home is probably the most well-known application of IoT. It includes devices like smart thermostats, intelligent refrigerators, connected televisions, and home automation systems.

3. **Healthcare**: IoT can transform reactive medical-based systems into proactive wellness-based systems. It can improve the power, precision, and availability of medical devices.

4. **Smart Cities**: Smart cities use technology to provide services and improve transportation and social services. IoT applications in smart cities could involve real-time routing, connected navigation, or shipment tracking.

5. **Agriculture**: IoT can be used to enhance agricultural practices by collecting data such as soil quality, sunlight levels, seed type, rainfall density from various sources like farm sensors, satellites, local weather stations, etc., and then using this data with Machine Learning and IoT to create custom recommendations for each farm.

6. **Smart Vehicles**: Self-driving cars and other connected vehicles rely on the internet to share real-time information. Sensors throughout the vehicle help map its surroundings, transmit camera footage, and respond to traffic signals.

7. **Industrial Automation**: IoT is a key component of Industry 4.0, the digital transformation of industrial markets. It helps in monitoring and controlling industrial operations, improving efficiency, and reducing operational costs.

These are just a few examples. The potential applications of IoT are vast and varied, and its impact is already being felt across a wide range of industries, including manufacturing, transportation, healthcare, and agriculture.

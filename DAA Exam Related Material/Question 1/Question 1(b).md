## Define different asymptotic notations.

Asymptotic notations are mathematical tools used to describe the running time of an algorithm when the input tends towards a particular value or a limiting value¹². There are mainly three types of asymptotic notations¹²:

1. **Big-O Notation (O-notation)** ¹²: Big-O notation represents the upper bound of the running time of an algorithm¹². Thus, it gives the worst-case complexity of an algorithm¹². For any value of n, the running time of an algorithm does not cross the time provided by O(g(n))¹².

2. **Omega Notation (Ω-notation)** ¹²: Omega notation represents the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm¹². Thus, it provides the best case complexity of an algorithm¹². For any value of n, the minimum time required by the algorithm is given by Omega Ω(g(n))¹².

3. **Theta Notation (Θ-notation)** ¹²: Theta notation encloses the function from above and below¹². Since it represents the upper and the lower bound of the running time of an algorithm, it is used for analyzing the average-case complexity of an algorithm¹².

These notations are used to analyze an algorithm as we are always interested in the worst-case, best-case, and average-case scenarios¹².

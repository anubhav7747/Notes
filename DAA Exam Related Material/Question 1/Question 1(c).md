## Explain the stable sort and in-place sort with the help of example.

Sure, let's discuss these two types of sorting:

1. **Stable Sort**⁵⁶⁷:
    - A sorting algorithm is called stable if it preserves the order of elements with the same sorting key⁵⁶⁷.
    - For example, consider a list of students with their names and grades. If two students have the same grade, they should appear in the same order in the sorted list as they were in the original list⁸.
    - Some Sorting Algorithms are stable by nature, such as Bubble Sort, Insertion Sort, Merge Sort, Count Sort, etc⁵.

2. **In-Place Sort**¹²³⁴:
    - An in-place sorting algorithm is an algorithm that does not need an extra space and produces an output in the same memory that contains the data by transforming the input 'in-place'¹²³⁴.
    - For example, Bubble Sort is an in-place sorting algorithm¹³. It works by repeatedly swapping the adjacent elements if they are in the wrong order¹³.
    - Other examples of in-place sorting algorithms include Selection Sort, Insertion Sort, and Heapsort¹.

## (i)	Define fractional knapsack problem.

The **Fractional Knapsack Problem** is a problem in combinatorial optimization where the goal is to fill a container (the "knapsack") with fractional amounts of different materials chosen to maximize the value of the selected materials⁵. Unlike the 0/1 Knapsack problem, where items cannot be broken, the Fractional Knapsack problem allows for items to be broken into smaller pieces, so that the knapsack can be filled up to its maximum capacity¹²⁴. The items in the knapsack are selected based on their value per unit of weight, with the items of higher value per unit weight being given priority¹²⁴. This problem can be solved efficiently using a greedy algorithm¹²⁴.

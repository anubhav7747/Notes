## Define P, NP, NP complete and NP hard classes of problems and give one example for each.

Sure, here are the definitions and examples for each of these classes of problems:

1. **P Class Problems**:
    - **Definition**: The P class consists of those problems that are solvable in polynomial time¹. These problems can be solved in time O(n^k) in the worst-case, where k is constant³.
    - **Example**: Calculating the greatest common divisor¹.

2. **NP Class Problems**:
    - **Definition**: The NP class consists of those problems that are verifiable in polynomial time³. These problems can be solved in polynomial time by a non-deterministic machine¹.
    - **Example**: Suppose there is a company having a total of 1000 employees having unique employee IDs. Assume that there are 200 rooms available for them. A selection of 200 employees must be paired together, but the CEO of the company has the data of some employees who can’t work in the same room due to personal reasons¹.

3. **NP-Complete Class Problems**:
    - **Definition**: A problem is NP-complete if it is both in NP and NP-hard¹. If any NP-complete problem can be solved in polynomial time, then every problem in NP can be solved in polynomial time¹².
    - **Example**: The traveling salesman problem⁷.

4. **NP-Hard Class Problems**:
    - **Definition**: A problem is NP-hard if all problems in NP are polynomial time reducible to it, even though it may not be in NP itself⁹.
    - **Example**: The Subset Sum Problem⁸.

Please note that these are high-level definitions and examples. The actual definitions involve more formal language and concepts from the field of computational complexity theory.

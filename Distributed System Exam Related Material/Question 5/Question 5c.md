## What is a transaction? What are the two main factors that threaten the atomicity of transaction? Describe how atomicity is ensured for a transaction in both commit and abort.

### Transaction:
In the context of databases and distributed systems, a transaction is a sequence of one or more operations that are executed as a single unit of work. The primary goal of a transaction is to ensure the consistency and integrity of the data by allowing a series of operations to be treated as a single, indivisible entity. The properties that transactions typically adhere to are known as the ACID properties:

1. **Atomicity:** All the operations in a transaction are treated as a single, indivisible unit. Either all operations are successfully completed, or none of them are applied.

2. **Consistency:** The execution of a transaction brings the database from one consistent state to another consistent state.

3. **Isolation:** The execution of a transaction is isolated from other concurrent transactions. Each transaction should operate as if it is the only transaction in the system.

4. **Durability:** Once a transaction is committed, its effects become permanent, even in the event of system failures.

### Factors Threatening Atomicity:
1. **System Failures:**
    - Failures such as crashes or power outages can occur at any point during the execution of a transaction, leading to an incomplete or inconsistent state.
2. **Application Failures:**
    - Errors within the application code or logical errors can result in incomplete or incorrect transactions.

### Ensuring Atomicity for a Transaction:
1. **Commit (Successful Completion):**
    - When a transaction successfully completes, and all operations are executed without errors:
      - All changes made by the transaction are permanently committed to the database.
      - The changes are made visible to other transactions.
      - The transaction is considered atomic, and the changes become part of the permanent database state.
2. **Abort (Unsuccessful Completion):**
    - When a transaction encounters an error or fails to meet certain criteria:
      - All changes made by the transaction are rolled back, and the database is restored to its state before the transaction started.
      - No changes made by the transaction are applied to the database.
      - The transaction is considered atomic in the sense that none of its changes are permanently applied.

### Ensuring Atomicity with Commit:
1. **Logging:**
    - Before making any changes, the system logs the current state or a before-image of the data affected by the transaction.
2. **Transaction Execution:**
    - The transaction's operations are executed, and the changes are applied to the database.
3. **Logging (Again):**
    - After successful execution, the system logs the after-image or the final state of the data affected by the transaction.
4. **Commit Record:**
    - A commit record is written to the log to indicate that the transaction has successfully completed.
5. **Persisting Changes:**
    - The changes made by the transaction are permanently applied to the database.

### Ensuring Atomicity with Abort:
1. **Logging:**
    - Before making any changes, the system logs the current state or a before-image of the data affected by the transaction.
2. **Transaction Execution:**
    - The transaction's operations are executed, but an error or failure occurs.
3. **Rollback:**
    - The system identifies the point of failure using the log and initiates a rollback, reverting the database to its state before the transaction started.
4. **Logging (Again):**
    - After rollback, the system logs the final state of the data affected by the transaction, indicating that the transaction has been aborted.
5. **Cleanup:**
    - Any temporary structures or changes made by the transaction are cleaned up, and the transaction is considered aborted.

Ensuring atomicity involves a combination of logging, tracking changes, and careful management of the transaction's state. These mechanisms help in recovering from failures and maintaining the consistency of the database even in the presence of errors.

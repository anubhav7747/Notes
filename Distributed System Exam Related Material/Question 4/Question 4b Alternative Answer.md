## What are phantom deadlock? Explain the algorithm which could detect phantom deadlock?

**Phantom Deadlock:**

Phantom deadlocks, in distributed systems, refer to situations where multiple processes or threads get stuck and can’t move forward because of conflicts in synchronization and resource allocation¹. This happens when different tasks are being executed at the same time causing each process to wait for a resource that is held by another process¹. Unlike deadlocks, where resources are explicitly locked and blocked, phantom deadlocks often occur due to dependencies that are not immediately obvious¹.

**Algorithm to Detect Phantom Deadlock:**

The detection of phantom deadlocks can be done using techniques such as the Wait-For Graph (WFG)¹. The WFG is a directed graph that represents the dependencies between processes and resources⁵. 

In the WFG representation of the workflow, we have processes (P1, P2, P3) and resources (R1, R2, R3). The arrows indicate the relationships where processes are waiting for resources or holding them¹. For instance, Process P1 is currently waiting for Resource R2, implying that P1 has made a request for R2 and cannot proceed until it obtains it¹. 

However, it's crucial to note that in distributed systems, due to network delays and the asynchronous nature of communication, nodes might not receive responses to their resource requests¹. This can lead to communication delays and the possibility of phantom deadlocks¹.

In the centralized approach of deadlock detection, two techniques are used: the Completely Centralized Algorithm and the Ho Ramamurthy Algorithm (One phase and Two-phase)⁴. The Completely Centralized Algorithm checks the wait-for graph to detect a cycle⁴. If the cycle exists, then it will declare the system as deadlock⁴. However, this technique has a possibility of phantom deadlock⁴.

The Ho Ramamurthy (Two-Phase Algorithm) reduces the possibility of phantom deadlock⁴. In this technique, a resource status table is maintained by the central or control site. If a cycle is detected, the system is not declared deadlock at first, the cycle is checked again⁴. If a cycle is detected again, then the system is declared as deadlock⁴. This technique reduces the possibility of phantom deadlock but on the other hand, time consumption is more⁴.

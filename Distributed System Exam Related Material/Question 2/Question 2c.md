## Explain the Chandy and Lamports snapshot algorithm for determining the global states of distributed systems.

The Chandy-Lamport algorithm is a snapshot algorithm used in distributed systems to record a consistent global state of an asynchronous system³. Here's a simplified explanation of how it works:

1. **Initialization**: Any process in the distributed system can initiate the global state recording algorithm using a special message called a MARKER¹.

2. **Marker Sending Rule**: When a process decides to record its state, it does two things¹:
    - It records its own local state.
    - It sends a marker message along each of its outgoing channels before sending any other messages along those channels¹.

3. **Marker Receiving Rule**: When a process receives a marker¹:
    - If it has not yet recorded its state, it records the state of the incoming channel as an empty sequence and then follows the marker sending rule¹.
    - If it has already recorded its state, it records the state of the incoming channel as the sequence of messages received along that channel after its state was recorded and before it received the marker¹.

The algorithm assumes that there are a finite number of processes in the distributed system and they do not share memory and clocks¹. Also, there are finite number of communication channels and they are unidirectional and FIFO ordered¹.

This algorithm is significant because it does not interfere with the normal execution of processes and can be used for various purposes such as creating checkpoints, garbage collection, deadlock and termination detection, and debugging¹. 

It's important to note that this is a high-level overview and the actual implementation can be quite complex, depending on the specifics of the distributed system¹.

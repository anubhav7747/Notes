## Discuss Suzuki Kasami broadcasting algorithm. We assumed there are 5 sites in a distributed system following Suzuki-Kasami algorithm for mutual exclusion. S0 has the token and is currently executing the critical section. (Assume that there were no prior/pending requests at this time). During this execution, S0 receives a request from S1 first and S2 next. After completing its execution, S0 forwards the token to S1. During this execution, S1 receives a request from S0 first and S3 next. After completing its execution, S1 forwards the token to S2.
The Suzuki-Kasami algorithm is a token-based algorithm for achieving mutual exclusion in distributed systems¹. It's a modification of the Ricart–Agrawala algorithm, which is a permission-based (non-token based) algorithm¹. In the Suzuki-Kasami algorithm, a site is allowed to enter its critical section if it possesses the unique token¹.

Let's break down the scenario you've described:

1. **S0 has the token and is executing the critical section**: During this execution, S0 receives a request from S1 first and S2 next. After completing its execution, S0 forwards the token to S1. This is in line with the algorithm's rule that the token should be forwarded to the next requesting site after the current site has finished executing its critical section¹.

2. **S1 receives the token and starts executing the critical section**: During this execution, S1 receives a request from S0 first and S3 next. After completing its execution, S1 forwards the token to S2. Again, this follows the algorithm's rule of forwarding the token to the next requesting site¹.

In this scenario, the Suzuki-Kasami algorithm ensures that each site gets a chance to execute its critical section in the order of their requests, thus achieving mutual exclusion¹. It's important to note that the token is passed along in the order of requests, not necessarily in the order of the sites¹.

This algorithm is efficient in terms of message complexity, requiring 0 message invocation if the site already holds the idle token at the time of critical section request or a maximum of N messages per critical section execution¹. However, one drawback is that it's a non-symmetric algorithm, meaning a site retains the token even if it does not have requested for critical section¹.

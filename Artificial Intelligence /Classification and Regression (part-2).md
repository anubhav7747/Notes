# Classification 

## Objective
In classification problems, the goal is to assign input data points to discrete categories or classes. The output is a label representing the class to which the input belongs. Classification either predicts categorical class labels or classifies data (construct a model) based on the training set and the values (class labels) in classifying attributes and uses it in classifying new data. The task of the classification algorithm is to find the mapping function to map the input(x) to the discrete output(y).

## Examples
- **Spam detection:** Classify emails as spam or not spam.
- **Image classification:** Identify objects or categories in images.
- **Medical diagnosis:** Predict whether a patient has a particular disease or not.
- when looking at transaction data, “fraudulent”, or “authorized”.

## Algorithms
- **Logistic Regression:** Despite the name, it's primarily used for binary classification.
- Decision Trees, Random Forest, Gradient Boosting.
- Support Vector Machines (SVM), k-Nearest Neighbors (k-NN), Neural Networks, etc.

## Evaluation Metrics
Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score, Area Under the Receiver Operating Characteristic (ROC) Curve (AUC-ROC), etc.

## Application
- **Spam filtering:** Identifying spam emails in an inbox
- **Fraud detection:** Detecting fraudulent transactions in financial data
- **Medical diagnosis:** Diagnosing diseases based on patient data
- **Image recognition:** Recognizing objects or scenes in images
- **Recommender systems:** Recommending products or services to users based on their past behavior

## Advantages
- Easy to understand and interpret
- Can handle a wide variety of data types
- Can be used for both binary and multiclass classification tasks

## Disadvantages
- Can be sensitive to outliers
- Requires a large amount of labeled data to train
- May not be suitable for very complex relationships between features and classes

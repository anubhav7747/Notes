# k-means Clustering Algorithm 
K-means clustering is a popular unsupervised machine learning algorithm used for partitioning a dataset into K distinct, non-overlapping subsets (or clusters). The objective is to group data points that are similar to each other and assign them to clusters based on certain features. The algorithm iteratively refines the cluster assignments until convergence.

Here are the main steps involved in the K-means clustering algorithm:

1. **Initialization**
   - Choose the number of clusters (K) that you want to identify in the dataset.
   - Randomly initialize K cluster centroids. These centroids represent the initial guesses for the centers of the clusters.

2. **Assignment Step**
   - Assign each data point to the nearest centroid. This is usually done based on the Euclidean distance between the data point and the centroids.

3. **Update Step**
   - Recalculate the centroids by taking the mean of all data points assigned to each centroid. This moves the centroid to the center of its assigned points.

4. **Repeat**
   - Repeat the assignment and update steps iteratively until convergence. Convergence occurs when the centroids no longer change significantly, or when a specified number of iterations is reached.

5. **Output**
   - The final result is K clusters, each associated with a centroid.

It's worth noting that the quality of the clusters obtained can be sensitive to the initial placement of the centroids. Therefore, K-means is often run multiple times with different initializations, and the result with the lowest overall sum of squared distances from data points to their assigned centroids is chosen.

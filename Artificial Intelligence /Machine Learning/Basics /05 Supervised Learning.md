# Supervised Learning
Supervised machine learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on a labeled dataset. In a supervised learning scenario, the training data consists of input-output pairs, where the input data is associated with corresponding output labels. The goal is to learn a mapping from the input space to the output space, allowing the algorithm to make predictions or decisions when presented with new, unseen data.

## Types of Supervised Learning
Supervised learning can be further divided into two types of problems:

### Classification:
  - **Definition:** In classification tasks, the goal is to predict the categorical class label of an instance. The output variable is discrete and represents a category or class.
  - **Examples:**
    - Binary Classification: Predicting whether an email is spam or not.
    - Multi-class Classification: Recognizing handwritten digits (0-9).
    - Medical diagnosis of diseases (e.g., classifying tumors as malignant or benign).

### Regression:
  - **Definition:** In regression tasks, the goal is to predict a continuous numerical value. The output variable is a real number, and the algorithm aims to learn a mapping from inputs to a continuous range of possible output values.
  - **Examples:**
    - Predicting house prices based on features such as square footage, number of bedrooms, etc.
    - Forecasting stock prices.
    - Estimating a person's age based on demographic information.

Supervised machine learning is used in various applications, including image and speech recognition, natural language processing, recommendation systems, medical diagnosis, fraud detection, and many others. The effectiveness of the model depends on factors such as the quality of the data, the choice of algorithm, and proper tuning of hyperparameters.

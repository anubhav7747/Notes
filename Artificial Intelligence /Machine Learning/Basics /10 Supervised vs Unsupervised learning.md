# Key Differences
Supervised learning and unsupervised learning are two major categories of machine learning, and they differ primarily in the type of data they are trained on and the nature of the learning tasks they perform.

1. **Labeling:**
    - **Supervised Learning:** Requires labeled training data with input-output pairs.
    - **Unsupervised Learning:** Involves unlabeled training data; the algorithm discovers patterns without explicit output labels.

2. **Tasks:**
    - **Supervised Learning:** Focuses on making predictions or decisions based on labeled data.
    - **Unsupervised Learning:** Focuses on exploring and uncovering patterns in data without predefined goals.

3. **Examples:**
    - **Supervised Learning:** Predicting, classifying, or regressing based on known outcomes.
    - **Unsupervised Learning:** Clustering, dimensionality reduction, and density estimation.

4. **Use Cases:**
    - **Supervised Learning:** Commonly used in scenarios where the goal is to predict or classify based on existing knowledge.
    - **Unsupervised Learning:** Applied when the objective is to explore and uncover hidden structures in the data.

# Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised machine learning is a type of machine learning where the algorithm is trained on unlabeled data, meaning that the training dataset does not have corresponding output labels. The system tries to learn the patterns and structures inherent in the data without explicit guidance on what the output should be. The primary goal of unsupervised learning is to explore the inherent structure of the data and find meaningful patterns or relationships.

## Types of Unsupervised Learning Algorithm:
The unsupervised learning algorithm can be further categorized into two types of problems:

### Clustering
  - **Description:** Grouping similar data points together based on certain criteria without predefined class labels.
  - **Examples:**
    - **K-Means Clustering:** Divides data into K clusters based on similarity.
    - **Hierarchical Clustering:** Forms a tree-like structure of clusters.
    - **DBSCAN (Density-Based Spatial Clustering of Applications with Noise):** Identifies clusters based on density.

### Association 
  - **Description:** Identifying patterns and relationships between variables in large datasets, often used for market basket analysis and rule mining.
  - **Examples:**
    - **Apriori Algorithm:** Discovers frequent itemsets and association rules in transactional databases.
    - **FP-growth (Frequent Pattern growth):** Efficient algorithm for mining frequent itemsets.

Unsupervised learning is particularly useful when dealing with large datasets where labeling the data is impractical or expensive. The insights gained from unsupervised learning can also be valuable for further analysis or for guiding subsequent supervised learning tasks.

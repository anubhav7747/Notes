## Difference between Classification and Regression 

**Classification Algorithm** | **Regression Algorithm** 
-----------------------------|-------------------------
Predicts a categorical output.|Predicts a continuous output.
Algorithms like Logistic Regression, Decision Trees, Support Vector Machines, k-Nearest Neighbors, Neural Networks, etc.|Algorithms like Linear Regression, Polynomial Regression, Support Vector Regression, etc.
Metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score.|Metrics like MSE, MAE, R-squared.
Used for categorizing data into predefined classes or labels.| Suitable for predicting quantities and estimating numeric values.
The Classification algorithms can be divided into Binary Classifier and Multi-class Classifier.|The regression Algorithm can be further divided into Linear and Non-linear Regression.
In Classification, we try to find the decision boundary, which can divide the dataset into different classes.|In Regression, we try to find the best fit line, which can predict the output more accurately.
**Examples:** Spam detection (spam or not spam), image classification (cat or dog), disease diagnosis (positive or negative), etc.|**Examples:** Predicting house prices, stock prices, temperature, sales revenue, etc.

# Regression

## Objective
In regression problem, the goal is to predict a continuous numeric value. The output is a real number, and the model's task is to learn the relationship between the input features and the target variable. In other words, regression is a statistical approach used to analyze the relationship between a dependent variable (target variable) and one or more independent variables (predictor variables). The objective is to determine the most suitable function that characterizes the connection between these variables. It seeks to find the best-fitting model, which can be utilized to make predictions or draw conclusions.

## Examples
  1. Predicting house prices based on features like size, number of bedrooms, etc.
  2. Forecasting stock prices based on historical data and relevant features.
  3. Estimating a person's age based on various demographic factors.

## Types
- **Simple Regression:**
    - Used to predict a continuous dependent variable based on a single independent variable.
    - SImple linear regression should be used when there is only a sinlge independent variable.
    
- **Multiple Regression:**
  1. Used to predict a continuous dependent variable based on multiple independent variables.
  2. Multiple linear regression should be used when there are multiple independent variables.

## Algorithms
  1. **Linear Regression:** Assumes a linear relationship between input features and the target variable.
  2. **Polynomial Regression:** Allows for more complex relationships by using polynomial functions.
  3. Support Vector Regression (SVR), Decision Trees, Random Forest, etc.

## Application
  - **Predicting prices:** For example, a regression model could be used to predict the price of a house based on its size, location, and other features.
  - **Forecasting trends:** For example, a regression model could be used to forecast the sales of a product based on historical sales data and economic indicators.
  - **Identifying risk factors:** For example, a regression model could be used to identify risk factors for heart disease based on patient data.
  - **Making decisions:** For example, a regression model could be used to recommend which investment to buy based on market data.

## Advantages
- Easy to understand and interpret
- Robust to outliers
- Can handle both linear and nonlinear relationships

## Disadvantages
- Assumes linearity
- Sensitive to multicollinearity
- May not be suitable for highly complex relationships

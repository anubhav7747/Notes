# k-Nearest Neighbor Algorithm

**Step-1:** Select the number K of the neighbors

**Step-2:** Calculate the Euclidean distance of K number of neighbors

**Step-3:** Take the K nearest neighbors as per the calculated Euclidean distance.

**Step-4:** Among these k neighbors, count the number of the data points in each category.

**Step-5:** Assign the new data points to that category for which the number of the neighbor is maximum.

**Step-6:** Our model is ready.

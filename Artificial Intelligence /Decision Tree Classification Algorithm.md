# Decision Tree Classification Algorithm
A Decision Tree is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. Here, I'll focus on its application in classification. The Decision Tree algorithm works by recursively partitioning the dataset into subsets based on the values of input features. Each internal node of the tree represents a decision based on a particular feature, and each leaf node represents the output label or class.

Here are the main steps involved in building a Decision Tree for classification:
1. **Node Selection**
   - Identify the feature that best separates or classifies the data. The selection is based on criteria such as Gini impurity or information gain (for classification tasks) and mean squared error (for regression tasks).

2. **Splitting**
   - Split the dataset into subsets based on the chosen feature and its threshold value. This process is performed recursively for each subset, creating a tree structure.

3. **Stopping Criteria**
   - Define stopping criteria to determine when to stop growing the tree. This could include a maximum depth for the tree, a minimum number of samples required to split a node, or a threshold for impurity measures.

4. **Leaf Node Assignment**
   - Assign a class label to each leaf node. For classification tasks, this is often the majority class of the instances in the leaf.

5. **Pruning (Optional)**
   - After the tree is built, pruning may be applied to remove branches that do not contribute significantly to the predictive accuracy. This helps avoid overfitting and improves generalization to unseen data.

6. **Prediction**
   - To make predictions for a new instance, traverse the tree from the root to a leaf node, following the decision rules at each internal node.

### Example
Consider a binary classification problem to predict whether an email is spam or not. Features might include the presence of certain keywords, sender information, etc. The decision tree might learn rules like "If the email contains the word 'free' and is from an unknown sender, classify as spam."

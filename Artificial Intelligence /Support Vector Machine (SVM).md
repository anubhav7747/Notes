### Support Vector Machine ###

- Support Vector Machine or SVM is one of the most popular Supervised Learning algorithms, which is used for Classification as well as Regression problems.
- However, primarily it is used for Classification problems in Machine Learning.
- The goal of the SVM algorithm is to create the best line or decision boundary that can segregate n-dimensional space into classes so that we can easily put the new data point in the correct category in the future.
- This best desicion boundary is called a hyperplane.
- There can be multiple lines/decision boundaries to segregate the classes in n-dimensional space, but we need to find out the best decision boundary that helps to classify the data points.
- This best boundary is known as the hyperplane of SVM.
- The dimensions of the hyperplane depend on the features present in the dataset, which means if there are 2 features (as shown in image), then hyperplane will be a straight line.
- And if there are 3 features, then hyperplane will be a 2-dimension plane.
- We always create a hyperplane that has a maximum margin, which means the maximum distance between the data points.

# Define the correlation coefficient (Pearson's r) and how to interpret the correlation coefficient.
**Pearson's correlation coefficient (r)** quantifies the linear relationship between two continuous variables. Here's how to interpret it:

1. **Range of Values**:
   - r ranges from -1 to 1.
   - **Positive r**: Indicates a positive linear relationship (as one variable increases, the other tends to increase).
   - **Negative r**: Indicates a negative linear relationship (as one variable increases, the other tends to decrease).
   - **r = 0**: No linear relationship (variables are independent).

2. **Strength of Correlation**:
   - **Close to 1 or -1**: Strong correlation.
   - **Close to 0**: Weak or no correlation.

3. **Direction**:
   - If r is positive, both variables move in the same direction.
   - If r is negative, they move in opposite directions.

4. **Example Interpretations**:
   - r = 0.8: Strong positive correlation.
   - r = -0.6: Moderate negative correlation.
   - r = 0.1: Weak positive correlation.

Remember, correlation does not imply causationâ€”it only captures linear associations! ðŸŒŸ

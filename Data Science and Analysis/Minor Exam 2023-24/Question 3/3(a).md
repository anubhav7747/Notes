# Calculate the mean and standard deviation of the following dataset: [10, 22, 27, 25, 30]. Interpret the results in the context of the data.
Let's calculate the mean and standard deviation for the given dataset:

1. **Mean (Average)**:
   - Sum of all values = 10 + 22 + 27 + 25 + 30 = 114
   - Number of data points = 5
   - Mean = $$\frac{114}{5} = 22.8$$

2. **Standard Deviation**:
   - Calculate the differences between each value and the mean:
     - $$10 - 22.8 = -12.8$$
     - $$22 - 22.8 = -0.8$$
     - $$27 - 22.8 = 4.2$$
     - $$25 - 22.8 = 2.2$$
     - $$30 - 22.8 = 7.2$$
   - Square these differences:
     - $$(-12.8)^2 = 163.84$$
     - $$(-0.8)^2 = 0.64$$
     - $$(4.2)^2 = 17.64$$
     - $$(2.2)^2 = 4.84$$
     - $$(7.2)^2 = 51.84$$
   - Calculate the average of these squared differences:
     - $$\frac{163.84 + 0.64 + 17.64 + 4.84 + 51.84}{5} = 47.16$$
   - Take the square root of this average:
     - $$\sqrt{47.16} \approx 6.86$$

3. **Interpretation**:
   - The mean (22.8) represents the central tendency of the data.
   - The standard deviation (approximately 6.86) indicates the spread or variability around the mean.
   - In this context, the data points are relatively close to the mean, with moderate variability.

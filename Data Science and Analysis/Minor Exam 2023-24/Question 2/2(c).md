# Construct a box plot for the following dataset: 3, 5, 8, 8, 9, 11, 12, 12, 13, 13, 16.
Let's create a box plot for the given dataset:

1. **Order the Data**:
   - Arrange the data in ascending order: 3, 5, 8, 8, 9, 11, 12, 12, 13, 13, 16.

2. **Calculate Quartiles**:
   - **First Quartile (Q1)**: The median of the lower half of the data (from 5 to 11) = 8.
   - **Third Quartile (Q3)**: The median of the upper half of the data (from 12 to 16) = 13.

3. **Interquartile Range (IQR)**:
   - IQR = Q3 - Q1 = 13 - 8 = 5.

4. **Identify Outliers**:
   - Any data point below Q1 - 1.5 * IQR or above Q3 + 1.5 * IQR is considered an outlier.

5. **Construct the Box Plot**:
   - Draw a box from Q1 to Q3 (8 to 13).
   - Add a line (whisker) from Q1 to the smallest data point (5) and from Q3 to the largest data point (16).
   - Mark any outliers separately.

Here's the box plot for the dataset:
```
   3  5  8  8  9 11 12 12 13 13 16
   |__|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|__|
```

The box represents the interquartile range, and the whiskers show the data spread. No outliers are present in this dataset. ðŸ“ŠðŸŒŸ

# Explain Skewness & Kurtosis in data science and their types with diagram.
Let's dive into skewness and kurtosis in data science:

1. **Skewness**:
   - **Definition**: Skewness measures the asymmetry of a distribution.
   - **Types**:
     - **Positive Skewness**: The tail extends to the right (right-skewed). Common in financial data, where extreme values occur.
     - **Negative Skewness**: The tail extends to the left (left-skewed). Seen in data like exam scores, where a minimum score exists.
     - **Zero Skewness**: A symmetric distribution with values evenly centered around the meanÂ¹.
   - **Visual Representation**:
     - In a right-skewed distribution, the tail stretches to the right, creating a "leaning" effect.
     - In a left-skewed distribution, the tail stretches to the left.
     - A symmetric distribution (zero skewness) has equal tails on both sides.

2. **Kurtosis**:
   - **Definition**: Kurtosis describes the shape of a distribution, focusing on its peak (or flatness) and tails.
   - **Types**:
     - **Leptokurtic**: Tall and narrow peak, heavy tails. Indicates more extreme values than a normal distribution.
     - **Mesokurtic**: Bell-shaped, similar to a normal distribution.
     - **Platykurtic**: Wide and flat peak, lighter tails. Indicates less extreme valuesÂ².
   - **Visual Representation**:
     - Leptokurtic distributions have a sharp peak.
     - Mesokurtic distributions resemble a standard bell curve.
     - Platykurtic distributions have a flatter peak.

Remember, understanding these metrics helps us interpret data shapes and make informed decisions in data science! ðŸ“ŠðŸŒŸ

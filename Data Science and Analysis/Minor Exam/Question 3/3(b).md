## Why sensor and actuators are important? Draw sensors define networks (SDN) architecture?
Sensors and actuators are crucial components of modern smart systems, playing a vital role in various applications across industries. Here's why they are important:

**Sensors** are devices that detect or measure physical properties and convert them into signals. They serve as the “eyes and ears” of a system, monitoring the environment and providing valuable data. For example, temperature sensors measure temperature in various environments, proximity sensors detect the presence or absence of nearby objects, and pressure sensors measure pressure in liquids or gases.

**Actuators** are devices that convert energy, typically electrical, into mechanical motion or control other devices or systems based on the input received. They serve as the “muscles” of a system, enabling it to perform various actions or tasks. Some common types of actuators include motors, solenoids, and servo motors.

Sensors and actuators work in tandem to create smart systems capable of responding to their environment. The sensor gathers data about a specific physical property, such as temperature or pressure, and transmits this information to a controller. The controller then processes the data, making decisions based on predefined rules or algorithms, and sends commands to the actuator. The actuator then performs the required action, adjusting the system accordingly.

As for Software Defined Networks (SDN), it is a networking architecture approach that enables the control and management of the network using software applications. SDN allows programmatic management, control, and optimization of network resources. It decouples network configuration and traffic engineering from the underlying hardware infrastructure, ensuring holistic and consistent control of the network using open APIs.

The three main components that make the SDN are:
1. **SDN Applications**: These relay requests or networks through the SDN Controller using API.
2. **SDN Controller**: This collects network information from hardware and sends this information to applications.
3. **SDN Networking Devices**: These help in forwarding and data processing tasks.

In SDN, the networking behavior of the entire network and its devices are programmed in a centrally controlled manner through software applications. This allows for better network connectivity, faster data sharing, better deployment of applications, improved security, and better control with high speed.

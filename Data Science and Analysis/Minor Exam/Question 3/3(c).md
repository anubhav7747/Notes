## Write short note on Box Plot, Heat Map and ANOVA?

1. **Box Plot**: A box plot, also known as a box-and-whisker plot, is a graphical representation of the distribution of a dataset. It summarizes key statistics such as the median, quartiles, and outliers, providing insights into the spread and central tendency of the data. The box plot shows the five-number summary of a set of data: including the minimum score, first (lower) quartile, median, third (upper) quartile, and maximum score. Box plots are useful as they provide a visual summary of the data enabling researchers to quickly identify mean values, the dispersion of the data set, and signs of skewness.

2. **Heat Map**: A heat map is a two-dimensional visualization revealing a relative intensity, or volume, of data. It uses color rather than digits, lines, graphs, or other representations to communicate relationships between data values for sets that would otherwise be harder to understand. Heat maps are essential in detecting what does or doesn't work on a website or page, and which parts and elements of a page users engage with.

3. **ANOVA (Analysis of Variance)**: ANOVA is a statistical method used to test differences between two or more means. It is similar to the t-test, but the t-test is generally used for comparing two means, while ANOVA is used when you have more than two means to compare. ANOVA is based on comparing the variance (or variation) between the data samples to the variation within each particular sample. If the between-group variance is high and the within-group variance is low, this provides evidence that the means of the groups are significantly different.

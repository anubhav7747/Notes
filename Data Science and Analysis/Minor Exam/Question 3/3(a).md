## What do you mean by descriptive statistics? Discuss its parameter and attributes. Why standard deviation is important for data analysis? Discuss with suitable example.
**Descriptive statistics** is a branch of statistics that deals with the summarization and description of collected data. It summarizes and organizes characteristics of a data set, which can be a collection of responses or observations from a sample or entire population. Descriptive statistics is primarily concerned with measures of central tendency, variability, and distribution, as well as graphical representations of data.

Here are the main components of descriptive statistics:

1. **Measures of Central Tendency**: These provide a summary statistic that represents the center point or typical value of a dataset. The most common measures of central tendency are the mean (average), median (middle value), and mode (most frequent value).
2. **Measures of Dispersion or Variability**: These provide a summary statistic that represents the spread of values in a dataset. Common measures of dispersion include the range (difference between the highest and lowest values), variance (average of the squared differences from the mean), standard deviation (square root of the variance), and interquartile range (difference between the upper and lower quartiles).
3. **Measures of Position**: These are used to understand the distribution of values within a dataset. They include percentiles and quartiles.
4. **Graphical Representations**: Data can be visually represented using various methods like bar graphs, histograms, pie charts, box plots, and scatter plots. These visuals provide a clear, intuitive way to understand the data.
5. **Measures of Association**: These measures provide insight into the relationships between variables in the dataset, such as correlation and covariance.

The **standard deviation** is a crucial concept in statistics as it helps in understanding the variability within a data set. It provides crucial insights into the degree of uncertainty and risk associated with a particular set of data, allowing for better decision-making and risk management. A high standard deviation indicates greater variability, while a low value shows data points are closer to the mean.

For example, suppose two pizza restaurants advertise a 20-minute average delivery time. One restaurant has a standard deviation of 10 minutes, indicating that the delivery times vary more widely. In contrast, the other restaurant has a standard deviation of 5 minutes, suggesting that the delivery times are more consistent. If you prefer predictability, you might choose the restaurant with the lower standard deviation. This example illustrates how standard deviation can provide valuable insights into the variability of a data set and inform decision-making.

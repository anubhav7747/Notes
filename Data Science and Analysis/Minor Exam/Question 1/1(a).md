## Discuss the various method of the data analysis. What is difference between data scientist and data analyst? What are the characteristics and difference between them?
The various methods of data analysis:

1. **Descriptive Analysis**: This type of analysis involves summarizing and describing the main characteristics of a dataset, such as the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, and range.
2. **Inferential Analysis**: This type of analysis involves making inferences about a population based on a sample.
3. **Predictive Analysis**: As the name suggests, this category of solutions employs machine learning models to estimate the future using past data trends.
4. **Prescriptive Analytics**: Prescriptive analytics uses the outcomes of descriptive and predictive analytics to formulate improved business strategies.
5. **Regression Analysis**: This is a statistical process for estimating the relationships among variables.
6. **Monte Carlo Simulation**: This is a computerized mathematical technique that allows people to account for risk in quantitative analysis and decision making.
7. **Factor Analysis**: This is a statistical method used to describe variability among observed, correlated variables in terms of a potentially lower number of unobserved variables called factors.
8. **Cohort Analysis**: This is a subset of behavioral analytics that takes the data from a given dataset and rather than looking at all users as one unit, it breaks them into related groups for analysis.
9. **Cluster Analysis**: This is a set of techniques used to classify different objects or cases into groups so that the degree of association between two objects is maximal if they belong to the same group and minimal otherwise.
10. **Time Series Analysis**: This comprises methods for analyzing time series data in order to extract meaningful statistics and other characteristics of the data.
11. **Sentiment Analysis**: This is the use of natural language processing, text analysis, computational linguistics, and biometrics to systematically identify, extract, quantify, and study affective states and subjective information.

Now, let's discuss the difference between a data scientist and a data analyst:

- **Data Analyst**: A data analyst examines large data sets to uncover actionable insights. They typically work with structured data to solve tangible business problems using tools like SQL, R or Python programming languages, data visualization software, and statistical analysis. They work toward answering business-related questions. Common tasks for a data analyst might include collaborating with organizational leaders to identify informational needs, acquiring data from primary and secondary sources, cleaning and reorganizing data for analysis, analyzing data sets to spot trends and patterns that can be translated into actionable insights, and presenting findings in an easy-to-understand way to inform data-driven decisions.

- **Data Scientist**: A data scientist is responsible for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting complex data to create predictive models and make data-driven decisions. They work on new ways to capture, store, manipulate and analyze that data. This role is generally considered a more advanced version of a data analyst. Some day-to-day tasks might include gathering, cleaning, and processing raw data, designing predictive models and machine learning algorithms to mine big data sets, developing tools and processes to monitor and analyze data accuracy, building data visualization tools, dashboards, and reports, and writing programs to automate data collection and processing.

In summary, while both roles work with data, a data scientist is typically more advanced and works with both structured and unstructured data, often using machine learning techniques. On the other hand, a data analyst usually works with structured data and focuses more on analyzing it to answer specific questions or identify trends.

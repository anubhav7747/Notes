## Design the architecture of logical and physical design of IoT. How both are difference from each other? Discuss the layer of IoT.

**Logical Design of IoT:**
The logical design of an IoT system is an abstract representation of the entities and processes without going into the low-level specifics of the implementation. It involves the use of functional blocks, communication models, and communication APIs. The functional blocks, including application, management, services, communication, security, and device components, collectively contribute to the operation of the IoT system.

**Physical Design of IoT:**
The physical design of an IoT system refers to the individual node devices and their protocols that are utilized to create a functional IoT ecosystem. Each node device can perform tasks such as remote sensing, actuating, monitoring, etc., by relying on physically connected devices. It may also be capable of transmitting information through different types of wireless or wired connections.

**Difference between Logical and Physical Design of IoT:**
The logical design is more conceptual and abstract than the physical design. In the logical design, you look at the logical relationships among the objects. However, in the physical design, you understand the most effective method of storing and accessing those objects. The logical design is less detailed than the physical design and is more conceptual. It’s the basic outline of how you want all those devices to talk and exchange information, but it doesn’t specify a particular technology or product.

**Layers of IoT:**
There are various IoT architectures available for IoT devices. However, the "5 Layer Architecture" is considered as the best-proposed architecture of IoT. The layers are as follows:

1. **Perception/Sensing Layer:** This is the first layer of IoT architecture. It includes sensors and actuators that gather information about temperature, humidity, light, sound, and other physical parameters.

2. **Network Layer:** This layer provides communication and connectivity between devices in the IoT system. It includes protocols and technologies that enable devices to connect and communicate with each other and with the wider internet.

3. **Data Processing Layer:** This layer refers to the software and hardware components that are responsible for collecting, analyzing, and interpreting data from IoT devices.

4. **Application Layer:** This layer manages all application processes based on information obtained from the data processing layer. This application involves sending emails, activating alarms, security systems, turn on or off a device, smartwatch, smart agriculture, etc.

5. **Business Layer:** This layer involves making flowcharts, graphs, analysis of results, and how the device can be improved, etc.

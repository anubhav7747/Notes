## What does you meant by sampling? What is standard method for sampling of data? What do you mean by data integration and transformation?
**Sampling** is a process in statistical analysis where researchers take a predetermined number of observations from a larger population. Sampling allows researchers to conduct studies about a large group by using a small portion of the population. The sample is the group of individuals who will actually participate in the research. The goal of sampling is to make the data more useful and meaningful for the purposes of analysis and decision making.

There are two primary types of sampling methods that you can use in your research:
1. **Probability Sampling**: This involves random selection, allowing you to make strong statistical inferences about the whole group.
2. **Non-Probability Sampling**: This involves non-random selection based on convenience or other criteria, allowing you to easily collect data.

**Data Integration** refers to the process of combining and harmonizing data from multiple sources into a unified, coherent format that can be put to use for various analytical, operational and decision-making purposes. The data integration process aims to overcome these challenges by bringing together data from disparate sources, transforming it into a consistent structure and making it accessible for analysis and decision making.

**Data Transformation** is a subset of data integration. It involves converting raw data into a machine-readable form, processing it through the CPU and memory to output devices, and formatting or transforming the output. This process is usually performed by a data scientist or team of data scientists. The process starts with data in its raw form and converts it into a more readable format (graphs, documents, etc.), giving it the form and context necessary to be interpreted by computers and utilized by employees throughout an organization.

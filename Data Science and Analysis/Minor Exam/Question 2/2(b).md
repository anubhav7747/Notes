## What is data discretization? Discuss its various methods. Why it's needed?
Data discretization refers to the process of converting continuous data attribute values into a finite set of intervals with minimal loss of information. It's a method of converting a large number of data values into smaller ones, making the evaluation and management of data easier. This process is usually carried out as a first step toward making them suitable for numerical evaluation and implementation on digital computers.

Here are some common methods of data discretization:

1. **Binning**: Binning is a top-down splitting technique based on a specified number of bins. Binning methods smooth a sorted data value by consulting its “neighborhood”, that is the values around it.
2. **Histogram Analysis**: A histogram partitions the values of an attribute into disjoint ranges, called buckets or bins. Histograms are effective at approximating sparse data, dense data, as well as highly skewed and uniform data.
3. **Cluster Analysis**: Cluster analysis is a form of data discretization. A clustering algorithm is executed by dividing the values of x numbers into clusters to isolate a computational feature of x.
4. **Decision Tree Analysis**: Data discretization refers to a decision tree analysis in which a top-down slicing technique is used. It is done through a supervised procedure.
5. **Correlation Analysis**: Discretizing data by linear regression technique, you can get the best neighboring interval, and then the large intervals are combined to develop a larger overlap to form the final 20 overlapping intervals.

Data discretization is needed for several reasons:

- It improves the quality of discovered knowledge.
- It simplifies the maintainability of the data.
- Many data mining algorithms require discretized data as they can only deal with discrete attributes.
- It reduces the running time of various data mining tasks such as association rule discovery, classification, and prediction.
- It prepares data for further analysis, e.g., classification.
- Discretization is considered a data reduction mechanism because it diminishes data from a large domain of numeric values to a subset of categorical values.

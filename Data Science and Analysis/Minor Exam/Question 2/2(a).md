## What is Raspberry Pi? Discuss the component and architecture of Raspberry Pi? Why it is use in IoT architecture?
**Raspberry Pi** is a series of small single-board computers (SBCs) developed in the United Kingdom by the Raspberry Pi Foundation in association with Broadcom. It's a credit card-sized computer board that can be plugged into a TV or monitor and provides a fully functional computer capability. It was launched in 2012 and there have been several iterations and variations released since then.

**Components and Architecture of Raspberry Pi:**
- **Processor:** Raspberry Pi uses Broadcom BCM2835 system on chip which is an ARM processor and Video core Graphics Processing Unit (GPU).
- **HDMI:** High Definition Multimedia Interface is used for transmitting video or digital audio data to a computer monitor or to digital TV.
- **GPIO ports:** General Purpose Input Output ports are available on Raspberry Pi which allows the user to interface various I/P devices.
- **Audio output:** An audio connector is available for connecting audio output devices such as headphones and speakers.
- **USB ports:** This is a common port available for various peripherals such as a mouse, keyboard, or any other I/P device.
- **SD card:** The SD card slot is available on Raspberry Pi. An SD card with an operating system installed is required for booting the device.
- **Ethernet:** The ethernet connector allows access to the wired network, it is available only on the model B of Raspberry Pi.
- **Power supply:** A micro USB power connector is available onto which a 5V power supply can be connected.
- **Camera module:** Camera Serial Interface (CSI) connects the Broadcom processor to the Pi camera.
- **Display:** Display Serial Interface (DSI) is used for connecting LCD to Raspberry Pi using 15 15-pin ribbon cables.

**Use of Raspberry Pi in IoT architecture:**
Raspberry Pi is an excellent platform for building IoT devices due to its low cost, small size, and extensive community support. It's used for IoT devices because of its affordability, versatility, computing power, connectivity, GPIO Pins, community support, security, and compatibility. It can function as a central hub in a wireless sensor network (WSN), enabling it to gather data from various sensor nodes and provide a range of services to multiple clients. It's also used in IoT applications ranging from home automation to robotics and edge computing.

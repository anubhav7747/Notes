## program to sort words in a sequence in decreasing order of their length. Display the sorted words along with their length.

Sure, here is a Python program that sorts words in a sequence in decreasing order of their length and displays the sorted words along with their length:

```python
# Define a sequence of words
words = ["Python", "Java", "C", "JavaScript", "C++", "Go"]

# Sort the words in decreasing order of their length
sorted_words = sorted(words, key=len, reverse=True)

# Display the sorted words along with their length
for word in sorted_words:
    print(f"{word} ({len(word)})")
```

In this code, `words` is a list of words. The `sorted()` function is used to sort the words. The `key` parameter of the `sorted()` function is set to `len`, which means the words are sorted based on their length. The `reverse` parameter is set to `True`, which means the words are sorted in decreasing order of their length. The sorted words are stored in the `sorted_words` list. Then, for each word in `sorted_words`, the word and its length are printed.

When you run this code, it will display each word in the sequence along with its length, sorted in decreasing order of length. For example, if the sequence is ["Python", "Java", "C", "JavaScript", "C++", "Go"], the output will be:

```
JavaScript (10)
Python (6)
Java (4)
C++ (3)
Go (2)
C (1)
```

This shows that "JavaScript" is the longest word with 10 characters, and "C" is the shortest word with 1 character. The other words are sorted in between according to their length. Remember to handle exceptions and edge cases as per your requirements. Also, the actual implementation of your code will depend on your specific needs and design choices. This is just a basic example to illustrate the concept. The `sorted()` function returns a new list that contains the sorted elements of the original list. The original list is not modified. If you want to sort the original list in place, you can use the `sort()` method of the list. The `sort()` method has the same parameters as the `sorted()` function, but it does not return a new list; it modifies the original list. If you want to sort the words in increasing order of their length, you can set the `reverse` parameter to `False` or omit it, because its default value is `False`. If you want to sort the words by some other criterion, you can define a custom function and use it as the `key` parameter. The custom function should take one word as input and return a value that will be used for sorting. For example, you can define a function that returns the number of vowels in a word, and use it to sort the words by the number of vowels. If you want to sort the words by multiple criteria, you can return a tuple from the custom function. The elements of the tuple will be used as the primary, secondary, etc., criteria for sorting. For example, you can define a function that returns a tuple of the length of a word and the word itself, and use it to sort the words by length and then by alphabetical order. If you want to sort the words in a case-insensitive manner, you can convert the words to lowercase or uppercase in the custom function. If you want to sort the words in a locale-aware manner, you can use the `locale.strxfrm()` function in the custom function. This function transforms a string into a form that is suitable for locale-aware comparison. If you want to sort the words in a natural order (i.e., considering numerical parts as numbers), you can use the `natsort.natsorted()` function from the `natsort` module. This function sorts a list of strings in a way that considers numerical parts as numbers, not as individual digits. For example, it sorts "2" before "10", unlike the standard sorting functions that sort "10" before "2" because "1" is less than "2". The `natsort` module is not part of the standard Python library, so you need to install it separately with pip or another package manager. If you want to sort the words in a way that considers special characters, accents, or other diacritical marks, you can use the `unicodedata.normalize()` function in the custom function. This function normalizes a Unicode string into a canonical form that can be compared in a consistent way. For example, it can transform a string with accented characters into a string with unaccented characters and separate combining diacritical marks, or vice versa. The canonical form to use depends on the specific requirements and conventions of your application. Always test your sorting function with various inputs to ensure that it works correctly and produces the expected results. If you encounter any issues or unexpected results, check the documentation of the sorting functions and methods, and use print statements or a debugger to inspect the intermediate results and the flow of the sorting process. If you are still stuck, you can ask for help on a programming forum or community, or you can ask me for more information or clarification.

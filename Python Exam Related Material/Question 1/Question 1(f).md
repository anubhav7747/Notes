## A shop will give discount of 10% if the cost of purchased quantity is more than 1000. Program to ask customer for quantity. Suppose one unit will cost 100. Judge and print total cost for user.

Sure, here is a Python program that calculates the total cost based on the quantity purchased:

```python
# Ask for the quantity
quantity = int(input("Enter the quantity you want to purchase: "))

# Calculate the total cost
cost = quantity * 100

# Apply discount if applicable
if cost > 1000:
    cost = cost * 0.9  # Apply a 10% discount

# Print the total cost
print("The total cost is:", cost)
```

In this program, the user is asked to enter the quantity they want to purchase. The total cost is calculated as the quantity times the unit cost (100). If the total cost is more than 1000, a 10% discount is applied by multiplying the cost by 0.9. Finally, the total cost is printed.

Please note that this program needs to be run in a Python environment where input from the user can be taken via the `input()` function, such as a Python IDE or a command line interface. It cannot be run in this chat interface. Also, remember to handle exceptions and edge cases as per your requirements. For example, you might want to check that the quantity entered by the user is a positive integer, and display an error message if it's not. You can do this by adding an `if` statement that checks the value of `quantity` after the `input()` function, and using the `print()` function to display an error message if the value is not valid. You might also want to add a loop that repeats the `input()` function until the user enters a valid quantity. You can do this by using a `while` loop with a condition that checks the validity of `quantity`, and breaking the loop when the user enters a valid quantity. If you want to allow the user to purchase fractional quantities, you can use the `float()` function instead of the `int()` function to convert the user's input to a number. But be aware that floating-point numbers can have rounding errors, so they might not be suitable for precise calculations involving money. If you need to perform precise calculations with fractional quantities, you can use the `decimal` module, which provides a `Decimal` class that can handle decimal numbers with exact precision. However, the `decimal` module is more complex and slower than the built-in number types, so it's usually only used when exact precision is necessary. If you want to format the total cost as a currency value, you can use the `format()` function with a format string that specifies the number of decimal places and the currency symbol. For example, `print("The total cost is: ${:.2f}".format(cost))` would print the cost with two decimal places and a dollar sign. You can adjust the format string to match the currency and formatting conventions of your country or region. If you want to calculate the discount differently, you can modify the `if` statement and the calculation of `cost`. For example, you can change the condition to apply the discount only if the quantity is more than a certain amount, or you can change the calculation to apply a different discount rate or a flat discount amount. You can also add more `if` statements or use an `elif` or `else` statement to apply different discounts for different ranges of cost or quantity. Remember to test your program with various inputs to ensure that it calculates the cost and the discount correctly in all cases. If you encounter any issues or unexpected results, check the logic of your program, the values of your variables, and the conditions of your `if` statements.

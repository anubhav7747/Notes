## What is module and package in Python? Explain the steps to import specific attributes from a module into the current Namespace with appropriate code snippets. Give an example of package creation in Python. Show the Package Module Structure of a "Video Player" project and explain all of its components.

In Python, a **module** is a file containing Python definitions and statements. The file name is the module name with the suffix `.py` added. Modules are used to organize related code into a single script. You can define functions, classes, and variables in your module.

A **package** is a way of organizing related modules into a directory hierarchy. Essentially, it's a directory that contains multiple module files and a special `__init__.py` file to indicate to Python that the directory is a package. Packages are a way of structuring Pythonâ€™s module namespace by using "dotted module names".

To import specific attributes from a module into the current namespace, you can use the `from ... import ...` statement. Here's an example:

```python
# Import the sqrt function from the math module
from math import sqrt

# Now we can use sqrt directly, no need to use math.sqrt
print(sqrt(16))
```

In this example, `sqrt` is a specific attribute (a function) of the `math` module. By using the `from ... import ...` statement, we import only this specific attribute into our namespace and can use it directly without prefixing it with `math.`.

Now, let's create a simple package in Python. Suppose we have the following directory structure:

```
mypackage/
    __init__.py
    module1.py
    module2.py
```

In this structure, `mypackage` is a package that contains two modules: `module1` and `module2`. The `__init__.py` file is required to make Python treat the directory as a package. This file can be empty.

Here's an example of a "Video Player" project's Package Module Structure:

```
videoplayer/
    __init__.py
    main.py
    ui.py
    controls.py
    formats/
        __init__.py
        mp4.py
        avi.py
        mkv.py
```

In this structure:

- `videoplayer` is the main package.
- `main.py` could be the main module where the application starts.
- `ui.py` could be a module that handles user interface.
- `controls.py` could be a module that handles play, pause, stop, etc.
- `formats` is a sub-package that handles different video formats.
- `mp4.py`, `avi.py`, `mkv.py` are modules in the `formats` sub-package that handle the respective video formats.

To use a function `play` from `controls.py`, you would import it like this:

```python
from videoplayer.controls import play
```

And then you can use the `play` function directly. Remember to handle exceptions and edge cases as per your requirements. Also, the actual implementation of your modules and packages will depend on your specific needs and design choices. This is just a basic example to illustrate the concept.

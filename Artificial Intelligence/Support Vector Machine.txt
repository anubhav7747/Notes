***Support Vector Machines (SVM)***

SVM is a relatively simple Supervised Machine Learning Algorithm used for classification and/or regression. It is more preferred for classification but is sometimes very useful for regression as well.

*The goal of the SVM algorithm is to create the best line or decision boundary that can segregate n-dimensional space into classes so that we can easily put the new data point in the correct category in the future. This best decision boundary is called a hyperplane.*

SVM chooses the extreme points/vectors that help in creating the hyperplane. These extreme cases are called as support vectors, and hence algorithm is termed as Support Vector Machine.

Basically, SVM finds a hyper-plane that creates a boundary between the types of data. In 2-dimensional space, this hyper-plane is nothing but a line. In SVM, we plot each data item in the dataset in an N-dimensional space, where N is the number of features/attributes in the data. Next, find the optimal hyperplane to separate the data. So by this, you must have understood that inherently, SVM can only perform binary classification (i.e., choose between two classes).

To perform SVM on multi-class problems, we can create a binary classifier for each class of the data. The two results of each classifier will be :
- The data point belongs to that class OR
- The data point does not belong to that class.

For example, in a class of fruits, to perform multi-class classification, we can create a binary classifier for each fruit. For say, the ‘mango’ class, there will be a binary classifier to predict if it IS a mango OR it is NOT a mango. The classifier with the highest score is chosen as the output of the SVM. SVM for complex (Non Linearly Separable) SVM works very well without any modifications for linearly separable data. Linearly Separable Data is any data that can be plotted in a graph and can be separated into classes using a straight line.

**Types of SVM**
SVM can be of two types:

*Linear SVM:* Linear SVM is used for linearly separable data, which means if a dataset can be classified into two classes by using a single straight line, then such data is termed as linearly separable data, and classifier is used called as Linear SVM classifier.
*Non-linear SVM:* Non-Linear SVM is used for non-linearly separated data, which means if a dataset cannot be classified by using a straight line, then such data is termed as non-linear data and classifier used is called as Non-linear SVM classifier.
